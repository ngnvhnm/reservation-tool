NOTE: Ths project is still on the early stages of development. The README will be updated as the project progresses.

== Overview
The DACH PC Reservation Tool is a web-based reservation system designed to streamline the booking of resources like parking slots and conference rooms. This tool aims to enhance resource utilization, scheduling, and user experience for authenticated users within an organization. Future versions may include the flexibility to book additional resources as well.

Additionally, the project will be made public, providing prospective applicants the opportunity to showcase their skills and analytical abilities by submitting Pull Requests. This approach allows candidates to engage with the codebase, propose improvements, and contribute actively to the project.

== Features

=== 1. Resource Reservation

The tool currently supports reservations for:
1. Parking slots
2. Conference rooms
3. Potential for additional resource type in future releases

=== 2. User Authentication

The application leverages Keycloak for secure user authentication, allowing only authorized personnel to access and make reservations.

=== 3. Calendar Integration

* Upon booking, the reservation system will add the booking creator as an attendee.
* This integration allows users to view their bookings directly on their personal calendars, ensuring they are kept informed of upcoming reservations.



== Technical Stack

=== Frontend
- https://react.dev/[React] + https://www.typescriptlang.org/[Typescript]
- https://vite.dev/[Vite]
- https://www.npmjs.com/[Node Package Manager (NPM)]
- https://mantine.dev/[Mantine.ui]

=== Backend
- https://spring.io/[Spring Boot]
- https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL]
- https://www.one.com/en/[One.com] API for calendar integration
- https://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] for user authentication
- https://www.docker.com/[Docker] for containerization

== How to start the app

=== Prerequisites
- https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk21-archive-downloads.html[Java 21] or higher
- https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker]
- Database Management System (DBMS) like Heidisql, DBeaver, or https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/connecting-to-a-database.html[IntelliJ Integrated Database Tool] or any other tool of your choice

=== Starting the backend
1. Open the terminal in the root directory of the project and navigate to the 'backend' folder and then start Docker:

        cd backend/ && docker-compose up -d  && cd ..

2. Start the backend by opening the 'backend' folder in your preferred IDE and run the main class `/src/main.java.com.dach.reservation_tool/ReservationToolApplication`. Preferably using https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA].

3. The server should now be running on `localhost:8080`. Make no other applications are using this port.

4. If needed, you can manage the database with your preferred DBMS and configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file in the `backend/src/main/resources` folder.

==== Configuring Keycloak
1. Open your preferred browser and navigate to `localhost:8080/`.
2. Log in with the following credentials:
    - Username: `admin`
    - Password: `admin`
3. Import the realm, which can be found in the `backend` folder under `reservation-tool-realm.json`. Import the file into Keycloak to load the configuration.
    - Go to `http://localhost:8084/admin/master/console/#/master/add-realm`
    - Choose the file `reservation-tool-realm.json`, which should be found in the `backend` folder.
    - Click `Create`.
4. Finally, a user must be added to log in to the application.
    - Go to `http://localhost:8084/admin/master/console/#/realms/reservation-tool/users`
    - Click `Add User` and fill in the required fields.
    - Click `Save`.

=== Starting the frontend
1. In the terminal, navigate to the 'frontend' folder and run the following commands:

        cd frontend/ && npm i && npm run dev

2. The frontend should now be running on `localhost:5173`. Make sure no other applications are using this port.

=== Testing the application

To verify that the application is working correctly, open your preferred browser and navigate to `localhost:5173` and open DevTools to check for any error messages.
